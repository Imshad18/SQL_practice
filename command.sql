SQL is case insensitive, still I will use all caps for SQL keywords

There is a table called Customers which has many columsns like CustomerID, CustomerName, City, etc


SELECT * FROM Customers;   -- this is SELECT Everything
This will give the entire table 

SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;
will returen CustomerName & City columns
